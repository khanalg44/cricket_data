# This is a repo for cricket-data visualization as well as data analysis.


## Early thought

1. Obtain the data
    a) A quick google search gave me access to all the t20 male cricket scorecard from this website.
        https://cricsheet.org/downloads/
    b) I think it'd be not too bad if we restrict our analysis for only top 10 t20 teams.
    c) First We'd want to get the list of matches between the teams in the list.
    d) Read all the scorecards and obtain the following data:
        i) The features on the X vector would be :
        TOSS, TEAM batting first scores first 6 overs, 6-10 ov, 10-15 ov, 15-20ov.
        ii) For now this can be enough. But for later we can add features like bowling analysis. 
        like Economy in 1st 6 overs, 6-10 ov, 10-15 ov, 15-20 ov.


2. Find what to do and how to do? Basically find the model and what you want to calculate.

3. Also the most imp thing is to get a working model first. And then slowly build on it.
